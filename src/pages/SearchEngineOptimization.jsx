                                One of the most frequent questions we are asked is whether SEO or PPC is better for a marketing campaign. Both are very different and determining the best one depends on your target market and what your goals are.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                SEO takes time but provides long-term steady results for strong organic rankings and traffic. With PPC, you start seeing results and ad positions instantly, and can easily refine your campaign to attract your ideal customer.

                                Generally speaking, we can see traction within a few weeks, but this will depend on the difficulty of your SEO campaign and targeted keywords. We generally say it can take between three to six months for the more competitive keyword rankings to increase.

                                For established sites with a good online reputation, the SEO changes made will have an almost immediate impact. If you have a newer site without an online track record, results will take more time. Rest assured, however, SEO is a powerful strategy that generates significant impact given careful setup and a little time.

                                There are many factors to consider when determining how long it will take to see results from an SEO campaign. For example, a newly established business with no online presence may take up to six months to see the results from SEO efforts. For a business with an existing online presence, results from SEO can be seen almost immediately.
