                                When you talk about branding, most people immediately think about your logo. But your brand is a lot more than that.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Your brand is who you are. It's what people think or say about you when you're not around. It's what you stand for. It's even how you make people feel.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Get it right: you're memorable to the right people. They feel more comfortable with you, which makes them more likely to take action.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Get it wrong: you're forgettable at best, put people off at worst. You end up fighting an uphill battle for results.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You never get a second chance at a first impression, so let's make that impression count.

                                    Let's be real: it isn't hard to find a cheap logo that looks decent. Heck, there's even free logo generators out there that can sometimes make something that will look... okay.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But remember, your brand isn't just your logo. And it's easy to make even a great logo look terrible, if you don't know how to use it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Having an experienced pro develop your brand means it's going to be way more likely to actually convey the message and feelings you want conveyed. It is way more likely to give the right impression, and actually stand out (in a good way). And it's way more likely to work and look good consistently.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Do your business a favor and make sure you're representing your brand in its best possible light.
