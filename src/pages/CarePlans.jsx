And considering you've invested good money to make sure your website is going to do a great job representing your business, why would you stop taking care of it after it's built?

And with a record number of hack attempts happening around the world every second, websites have never been at greater risk of being compromised.

                                If your website is built on the WordPress platform, then the answer is yes.

                                It really isn't WordPress's fault. The platform grew incredibly fast and there are, currently, more than 55,000 WordPress add-ons (aka plugins). Currently, WordPress powers over 43% of the web.

                            <p>
                                This makes it one of the biggest hacker targets on the planet.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Additionally, all websites require some routine maintenance. Just like cars, you must<em>&nbsp;</em>change the oil, rotate the tires, and put in required repairs if you want to reliably get from point A to B. That's what our care plans provide.

                                Barring security patches (of which there are many), there are two factors that dictate how often your website plugin needs to be updated.
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>The number of plugins installed on your website.</strong>&nbsp;More plugins = more chances of security patches that need to be applied.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>The type of plugins.</strong>&nbsp;Certain plugins are better maintained and coded and require fewer updates.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>It is common for a business website to have between 15 and 30 plugins installed and require 10 to 20 individual updates per month.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are over 55,000 plugins to choose from and some need to be updated on a weekly basis.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the two years since we've provided weekly plugin updates for 60+ clients, we have had two security issues that got through. Both websites were fixed within four hours with zero data loss.

                                Domain name renewal notices usually only come in email and should be sent from your existing domain registrar.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                (To verify where your domain name is registered please visit <a className="text-link" href="https://who.is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WHOis</a> and type in your domain name.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Your domain name is your most valuable online asset, even though it only costs $15 or so a year for a dotcom. If someone else gains access to your domain, your entire online persona can be ruined.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When in doubt please contact your existing domain registrar. If you don't know who that give us a call and we'll look into it (for free). We can't stand the idea of anyone losing their domain name.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                ps. If the domain name renewal is more than $30 a year for a dot com, it's either a scam or an unethical domain provider.

                                We believe our clients should always take direct ownership and make payment of their domain name.
                        </p>
                            <p>
                                A domain name is the most important point of access to your website and more valuable than the website itself (if the website is backed up somewhere that is). After all, if someone else takes control of your domain, they can point it anywhere. And your emails wouldn't work anymore.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Since a domain name typically costs $15 or less per year we recommend renewing your domain name for five (5) years at a time and putting several notices in your calendar about the future renewal.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It really is so important.

                                99% of the time these are robots blasting out automated emails with a generic list of issues (which usually aren't even happening on <em>your</em> site), and then offering to fix those issues in the hopes of landing you as a client.
