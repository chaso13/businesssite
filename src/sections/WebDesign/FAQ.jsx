More often than not, people coming to us for a new site have websites with serious fundamental flaws at their core. We refuse to start work on a flawed base as it will lead to a flawed end result, and that sacrifices on our professional integrity.</li><li>The way your website is built adds constraints and limitations on what is possible. By starting from scratch we can design what we know is going to work, confident that we can build anything we need, rather than limiting the design to something we know will work with your existing technology but may not deliver the outcomes we need it to. We won't do that.</li></ul><p>But this doesn't mean your existing website is automatically bad or wrong. One of the first things we do with a potential client is assess whether they even need a new website. Sometimes, your current website is totally fine and just needs some updated content, or potentially some more marketing efforts. If that's the case, we let you know (in fact, we only end up working with about 10% of businesses that contact us).</p><p>Ultimately, our role is to guide our clients to the right solution for them, whether that solution includes Thrive or not.</p></div></div><div id="div_block-261-831" class="ct-div-block"><div id="_toggle-262-831" class="oxy-toggle toggle-9930" data-oxy-toggle-initial-state="closed" data-oxy-toggle-active-class="toggle-9930-expanded">

                                there are many plugins that do the heavy lifting. This can cut development

                                you as a client. Don't get tied to an agency because the website they build
                                you is on a niche system that is hard to find help for - so you HAVE to
                                rely on them, even if the relationship breaks down later.

                            offers a lot of flexibility both short and long term.
